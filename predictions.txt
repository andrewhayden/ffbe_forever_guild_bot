# Predictions text for the module predictions.py.
# You can customize predictions by adding/editing them here.
# Lines that start with a # are comments and are ignored.
#
# Predictions are one line each. You can add "#tags" at the end of a predictions
# to make it more likely to get used for a query that includes the tag. Within tags,
# underscores will be converted to spaces, allowing you to match phrases. The tags
# themselves are (obviously) ignored and not printed by the bot at runtime. If only
# one prediction matches the tags in the text, it will always be chosen - so it's
# advised to always have at least two predictions for every tag!
#
# Predictions with tags will only ever be used for queries that match them. If your
# tags are very specific, you can have some very specific predictions :)
#
# For example the following prediction would be more likely to show up when someone
# types "Will I pull Yuna today?":
#    Only after spending at least 30,000 visiore :( #will_i_pull
# And the following prediction is more likely to show up for "will I win?"
#    You can't lose! As a knight of Grandshelt! :thumbsup: #win #lose
